# Statistics #01 - Descriptive
You will start building the foundation you need to think statistically, to speak the language of your data, to understand what they are telling you.





## Why complete this?
The foundations of statistical thinking took decades upon decades to build, but they can be grasped much faster today with the help of computers. With the power of Python-based tools, you will rapidly get up to speed and begin thinking statistically by the end of this course.


## Learning Objective
After this lesson, you'll be able to
1. Learn how to summarize your data
2. Learn about discrete and continuous variables
3. Work with standard deviation , variance and spread in Python
