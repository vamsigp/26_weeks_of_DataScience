# OOP in Python & First Steps with NumPy 
<br/><br/>
## OOP in Python
Though some people consider OOP to be a modern programming paradigm, the roots go back to 1960s. The first programming language to use objects was Simula 67.  Why use Object Oriented Programming? Because if you stick to the rules, it makes complex code easier to develop, more relieable, more maintainable, and generally better.

* Because OOP insists that you think about what you expose to the outside world, it lets you change the implementation of an object without affecting any other code. (Encapsulation)
* Because it allows you to have many different functions, all with the same name, all doing the same job, but on different data. (Polymorphism)
* Because it lets you write generic code: which will work with a range of data, so you don't have to write basic stuff over, and over again. (Generics)
* Because it lets you write a set of functions, then expand them in different direction without changing or copying them in any way. (Inheritance)

## Numpy Basics
NumPy is not just more efficient; it is also more convenient. NumPy's arrays are more compact than Python lists -- a list of lists as you describe, in Python, would take at least 20 MB or so, while a NumPy 3D array with single-precision floats in the cells would fit in 4 MB.

NumPy is a Python package to efficiently do data science. Learn to work with the NumPy array, a faster and more powerful alternative to the list, and take your first steps in data exploration.
