# Plot with Pandas


Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematical extensions like NumPy. Get rolling with matplotlib!  

## Why complete this?
Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to view analytical graphics, presented visually, so that they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.

Why is it important?
* Patterns emerge quickly
* Exceptions and Outliers are Made Obvious
* Aids faster decision making 
* Clarify which factors influence behavior

## Learning Objective
After this lesson, you'll be able to
* Provide a stronger foundation in data visualization in Python
* Following a review of basic plotting with Matplotlib, this chapter delves into customizing plots using Matplotlib. 
* Showcases various techniques for visualizing two-dimensional arrays
* Customizing graphics, plotting two-dimensional arrays (e.g., pseudocolor plots, contour plots, images, etc.)
* Customizing statistical graphics (e.g., visualizing distributions & regressions)
